## Tech Stack
### Vite, React, Styled Components, Typescript

I wanted to build a shopping cart using React hooks to manage the client side data.    

One of the lessons I learned is that mobile browsers do not have a hover state, and will need a different UI if the desktop browser utilizes hover states. Going forward, building mobile first will eliminate some of these issues.
